# Python-Socket-Programming-Minigame
This is a python socket programming project which involves setting up a server that is accessible by hosts that are connected to the same internet connection as 
the server host device. This program will allow other end systems to access the simpleWeb.html file or the minigame.html file. The simpleWeb.file will display
basic welcome message when the website is accessed. The minigame.html file will open up a html web game which allows end systems to play.
